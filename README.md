# Speech Recognition

This project explores the implementation of speech recognition techniques using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). It provides a foundational understanding of these methods through practical examples and code.

## Project Structure

- **`forward algorithm.ipynb`**: Demonstrates the implementation of the forward algorithm, a fundamental component in HMMs, applied to speech recognition tasks.

- **`hmm.ipynb`**: Provides an in-depth look into constructing and utilizing Hidden Markov Models for modeling sequential data in speech.

- **`mfcc.ipynb`**: Focuses on the extraction and analysis of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, which are critical features used in processing and recognizing speech signals.
